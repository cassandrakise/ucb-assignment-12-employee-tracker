# ucb-assignment-12-employee-tracker
The following application was created in tandem with UC Berkeley's Extension school's full stack coding bootcamp. This assignment features a MySQL database, which when started allows the users to view all employees including their roles, departments, salaries, IDs, and manager IDs. In addition to viewing, the user can select to view many of these categories separately, as well as adding additional roles, departments, employees, and updating several of these. Finally, the user is able to Quit the program.
